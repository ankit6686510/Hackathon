### 3. **Enhanced AI Search - Code Generation**

**Method**: `POST`  
**URL**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search`  
**Headers**: 
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body** (raw JSON):
```json
{
  "query": "write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key",
  "top_k": 1
}
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key",
  "ai_response": "Here's a comprehensive solution for sorting a list of dictionaries:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_list(dict_list, key, reverse=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key\n    \n    Args:\n        dict_list: List of dictionaries to sort\n        key: Key to sort by\n        reverse: Sort in descending order if True\n    \n    Returns:\n        Sorted list of dictionaries\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(dict_list, key=lambda x: x.get(key, 0), reverse=reverse)\n\n# Usage examples:\nstudents = [\n    {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 85},\n    {'name': 'Bob', 'grade': 92},\n    {'name': 'Charlie', 'grade': 78}\n]\n\n# Sort by grade (ascending)\nsorted_students = sort_dict_list(students, 'grade')\nprint(sorted_students)\n# Output: [{'name': 'Charlie', 'grade': 78}, {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 85}, {'name': 'Bob', 'grade': 92}]\n\n# Sort by grade (descending)\nsorted_desc = sort_dict_list(students, 'grade', reverse=True)\nprint(sorted_desc)\n```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Use `get()` method to handle missing keys safely\n- Consider using `operator.itemgetter()` for better performance with large datasets\n- Add type hints for better code documentation",

### 4. **Enhanced AI Search - General Knowledge**

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body** (raw JSON):
```json
{
  "query": "explain machine learning in simple terms",
  "top_k": 1
}
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "explain machine learning in simple terms",
  "ai_response": "Machine Learning is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make predictions, similar to how humans learn from experience.\n\n**Simple Analogy:**\nThink of it like teaching a child to recognize animals:\n- Show them 1000 pictures of cats and dogs\n- They learn the differences (cats have pointy ears, dogs vary more in size)\n- Now they can identify new cats and dogs they've never seen\n\n**How it works:**\n1. **Training**: Feed the computer lots of data with known answers\n2. **Learning**: The computer finds patterns in the data\n3. **Prediction**: It uses those patterns to make guesses about new data\n\n**Real Examples:**\n- Netflix recommending movies you might like\n- Email filtering spam automatically\n- Voice assistants understanding what you say\n- Photo apps recognizing faces\n\n**Types:**\n- **Supervised**: Learning with examples (like the cat/dog example)\n- **Unsupervised**: Finding hidden patterns in data\n- **Reinforcement**: Learning through trial and error (like game AI)\n\nThe key is that the computer gets better at its job the more data it sees, just like humans get better with practice!",

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Unlimited AI Capabilities
1. **Technical Question**: "Redis connection timeout in production"
2. **Code Generation**: "create a REST API endpoint in FastAPI"
3. **General Knowledge**: "what is blockchain technology"
4. **Creative Task**: "help me write a project proposal"

### Scenario 2: Test Query Classification
Send different types of queries and verify the `query_type` in responses:
- Technical issues ‚Üí `technical_issue`
- Code requests ‚Üí `code_help`
- General questions ‚Üí `conversational` or `general`

### Scenario 3: Test Historical Data Integration
Send technical queries that might match your historical issues and verify:
- `has_historical_data: true`
- Relevant historical matches with scores
- AI-generated fix suggestions

---

## üîç Response Analysis

### Key Fields to Check:
- **`query_type`**: Verify correct classification
- **`has_historical_data`**: True for technical issues with matches
- **`response_time_ms`**: Should be under 3000ms
- **`ai_response`** or **`results`**: Quality and relevance of responses

### Success Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Health check returns 200 OK
- ‚úÖ All query types get appropriate responses
- ‚úÖ No more "I only help with technical issues" restrictions
- ‚úÖ Code generation includes working examples
- ‚úÖ General questions get helpful explanations

---

## üöÄ Advanced Testing

### Custom Headers (Optional):
```
X-User-ID: test-user-123
X-Session-ID: session-456
```

### Batch Testing:
Create a collection with all the above requests and run them sequentially to verify all capabilities work.

### Performance Testing:
- Send multiple concurrent requests
- Measure response times
- Verify system stability

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

Your enhanced SherlockAI should now:
1. **Accept ANY question** - no restrictions
2. **Provide intelligent responses** for all query types
3. **Generate code** with explanations and examples
4. **Answer general knowledge** questions helpfully
5. **Maintain technical expertise** with historical data integration

**No more frustrating "I only help with technical issues" responses!** üéâ
